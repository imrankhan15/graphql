# graphql
This app fetches data from github repo using graph ql and shows in a table view

Here I have used - Swift, UIKIT, Swift package manager, Graphql, Table view, Apollo, MMVM, Dependency Injection, Unit Testing for Web Api

1. You can change the graphql file. Then need to delete the API.swift file manually.  In the next run new API.swift file will be generated. No other search field used.
2. No other third party library used.
