# graphql

Here I have used - Swift, UIKIT, Swift package manager, Graphql, Table view, Apollo

1. You can change the graphql file. Then need to delete the API.swift file manually.  In the next run new API.swift file will be generated. No other search field used.
2. No other third party library used.
