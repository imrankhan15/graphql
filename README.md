# graphql

This app fetches data from GitHub repo using graph ql and shows it in a table view

Here I have used - Swift, UIKIT, Swift package manager, Graphql, Table view, Apollo, MMVM, Dependency Injection, Unit Testing for Web API

We have used dependency injection to inject the network service into the main view controller. With the Unit test, the functionality of the web API call is tested.

We used Apollo to execute the graphql query. Swift package manager was used to install the Apollo framework.
